<H1>C++</H1>
C++ is a large language based on <A href="../c/index.html"> C</A> that
adds classes (with both statically and dynamically despatched methods,
and allowing multiple inheritance); exception handling; generic
programming through templates; operator overloading and a standard
library of container classes and algorithms. The language (originally
called 'C with classes') was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell
Labs starting in 1979.
<P>
The history of C++ is described by Stroustrup in a paper from the <A
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HOPL"> HoPL II</A> (History of
Programming Languages II) conference which you can read <A
href="http://www.research.att.com/~bs/hopl2.pdf">here</A>. That paper
was subsequently extended to a full length book: 'The Design and
Evolution of C++', Bjarne Stroustrup; Addison Wesley; 1994 ISBN
0-201-54330-3.
<P>
A notable of feature of C++ is it's ongoing evolution. Commercial
and free compilers for C++ have at various points in its history both
lagged and led the standardisation efforts which can lead to a lot of
confusion.
<P>
Broadly, at the time of writing (October 2006) there are seven generations of C++.
<ol>
<li> <STRONG>[Pre-1985: C with classes]</STRONG> Stroustrup originally
focussed on adding abstract data types to C by using the class
concept pioneered by Simula. Inheritance was supported, but not
virtual functions, and hence there was no runtime polymorphism. Most
people (including Stroustrup) would not call such a language object
oriented. This language was internal to Bell Labs.
<P>
<li> <STRONG>[1985: Cfront Release 1.0]</STRONG> The first commercial
release of the renamed C++ was in 1985. Virtual functions had been
added and C++ was marketed as an object oriented
extension to C. C++ remains essentially a superset of <A
href="../c/index.html">C90</A> (although there are some subtle
incompatibilities for all you language lawyers out there).
<P>
This version is described in 'The C++ programming Language', Bjarne
Stroustrup; Addison Wesley; 1986 ISBN 0-210-12078-X.
<P>
<li> <STRONG>[1989: Cfront Release 2.0]</STRONG> The second release
added multiple inheritance, abstract classes and a large number of
other features such as pointers to members.
<P>
<li> <STRONG>[1990: The
annotated reference manual (ARM)]</STRONG> This was not a language
version <em>per se</em> but a document which was to become the basis
of the standardisation effort. Published as 'The Annotated C++
Reference Manual', Margaret A. Ellis and Bjarne Stroustrup; Adison
Wesley; 1990 ISBN 0-210-51459-1, the ARM described both the features
of Release 2.0 and features that had not yet been implemented,
including exceptions and templates. It is really both an informal
standards document and a roadmap for future development. <li>
<P>
<STRONG>[1991: Cfront Release 3.0]</STRONG> The third release
incorporated features from the ARM, including templates for generic
programming and exception handling.
<P>
This version is described in 'The C++ programming Language, second edition', Bjarne
Stroustrup; Addison Wesley; 1991 ISBN 0-210-53992-6.
<P>
<li> <STRONG>[1998: C++98 (ISO/IEC 14882:1998)]</STRONG> ANSI
established committee X3J16 to standardise C++ in 1989. The final
draft standard was put out to public vote in 1997, and ratified in
1998. A corrected standard was published in 2003 as ISO/IEC 14882:2003.
<P>
This version is described in 'The C++ programming Language (Special Edition)', Bjarne
Stroustrup; Addison Wesley; 2000 ISBN 0-201-70073-5 and in 'The C++ programming Language (Third Edition)', Bjarne
Stroustrup; Addison Wesley; 1997 ISBN 0-201-88954-4. The 'Special
Edition' is hardbound and contains two extra appendices and a large
number of typographical fixes.
<P>
This is the grammar from Annex A of the 1997 public review
document. Since this draft was unanimously accepted, we believe that
it is the same grammar as in the actual standard, but we have not yet
checked against an official copy.

<P>
<li> <STRONG>[200x: C++0x (ISO WG 21 C++0x draft standard)]</STRONG>
Standardisation efforts continue. Most people expect only small
changes to the language, but significant extensions to the
library. For Stroustrup's own take on things, see
<A href="http://www.research.att.com/~bs/rules.pdf">The design of C++0x</A>.
You can keep up with the current thinking by checking the
<A href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21"> WG21 committee pages<A>.

The main output so far has been
'Technical Report 1' which concerns proposed extensions to the
library, which include regular expressions, safe pointers and better
random number generation facilities.
