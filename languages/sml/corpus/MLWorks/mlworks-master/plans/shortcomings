List of identified problems with the MLWorks interface

Context Browser:
@Should display a textual path to the current object being examined
Module browser is the same thing really
%Use single click to select an item, with menu items for other
%operations on selected object.
%Use double click to examine a sub object in the context.
@Need to show the id status of value identifiers somehow, perhaps in a
@similar way to interprint. (Did we reach a decision on this?).
Automatic update of context browser display would be nice.
@Need to show type variables for types and datatypes.
@The context browser should have an options menu (needs print options)
%Is there any way of stopping the double redisplay of lists?
Need an indication of which context is being browsed (this is a
general point for all tools that have a context).
%Should be able to call inspector from the context browser.
Need browser for modules, whatever they are.

Listener:
Ctrl-U deletes entire line
@Return before the prompt shouldn't evaluate input
@Problems with deleting text before the prompt
Is the push & popping of context the right interface -- I'm still not
sure what reasonable alternatives are.
It should be easier to position cut text at the end of the buffer --
the standard behaviour is wrong.
@Flickers when pasting history.
Possibly a results history in the listener.
Visual indication of which context is current
Pretty Printing of values

Inspector:
Needs an options menu
@Poor (non-existent) handling of errors in user-defined inspector
@functions
@On startup, should inspect "it" by default, with appropriate behaviour
@if "it" is unbound.
@Poor (non-existent) handling of errors in evaluation of expressions.
Grapher

TTY listener:
Closure of standard streams not handled well.

File Browser:
Motif file selection box is poor.

Podium:
@Menus obscure menu bar.
@Do we need a podium? -- yes.

Debugger:
@Line numbers and file names get in the way
@Arguments should be displayed with function names
@Need selective display of types of frames
Backtrace goes too far after a break

Tracing:
Should have option to enter windowing debugger on break
Nice way to specify tracing options?

General:
%Combine File and Tools menus to form a Works menu.
Empty menus need a minimum width.
%Need better history in inspector and context browser.
Modeless dialogs for histories.
Keyboard shortcuts, mnemonics,accelerators,tab rings, etc.
Limit length of histories (and avoid duplicate entries too).
Options groups - e.g. simulate NJ with a single pushbutton.
Might be nice to suppress value printing when using files, particularly .mlworks
Need to test with different window managers
Need a naive user mode
Maybe use a RTF widget for online documentation
