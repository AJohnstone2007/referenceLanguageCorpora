See README.txt for the explanation that customers get on how to run
the example.

Given that the directory structure is different in a development tree,
those instructions don't work unaltered here.

The changes you need to make are :-

* It is up to you to know which platform you are on and choose the
  correct Makefile and also set MLWORKS_INCLUDE.  For example, under
  under SunOS, you can build the library by doing :-

    $ make -f Makefile.SunOS MLWORKS_INCLUDE=../../../src/rts/src

* To run the example from this directory you need to set up the
  source-path to point at the src directory of your development tree.
  Assuming you want to point to the one contained in the same tree as
  the demo directory, then under Solaris you'd type something like :-

    $ ../../../src/rts/bin/SPARC/Solaris/main-g -load ../../../src/images/SPARC/Solaris/gui.img -pass args -tty -source-path .:../../../src args

From then on the instructions are as per README.txt
