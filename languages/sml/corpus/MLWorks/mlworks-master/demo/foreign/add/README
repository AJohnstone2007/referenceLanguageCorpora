A simple foreign interface example that involves calling a C function
to add two numbers and return the result.

See README.txt for the explanation that customers get on how to run
the example.

Given that the directory structure is different in a development tree,
those instructions don't work unaltered here.

The changes you need to make are :-

* it is up to you to know which platform you are on and choose the
  correct Makefile.  For example, under Solaris you'd need to do :-

    $ make -f Makefile.Solaris

* You need to set up MLWORKS_INCLUDE and if running under Win32 you
  need to set up MLWORKS_LIB.  The former is in the rts/src directory
  and the latter in the rts directory.  For under SunOS you'd write
  something like 

    $ make -f Makefile.SunOS MLWORKS_INCLUDE=../../../src/rts/src

  and under NT :-

    $ make -f Makefile.Win32 MLWORKS_INCLUDE=../../../src/rts/src MLWORKS_LIB=../../../src/rts/runtime.lib


* You need to add either Win32 or Unix to the MLWorks source path as
  is appropriate for the platform you are developing on.  For example,
  under SunOS you'd do something like :-

    $ ../../../src/rts/bin/SPARC/SunOS/main-g -load ../../../src/images/SPARC/SunOS/gui.img -pass args -tty -source-path Unix:.:../../../src args

From then on the instructions are as per README.txt
