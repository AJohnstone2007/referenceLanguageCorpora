Note this example is SunOS specific even though it uses standard
directory(3) functions.  Making it work on other Unix platforms is a
simple matter of making the field accessors in __dirent match those in
<sys/dirent.h> on that particular platform.  This isn't difficult, it
is just tedious and error prone.  It hasn't been done now because this
is what the stub generator will do when it is written.

See README.txt for the explanation that customers get on how to run
the example.

Given that the directory structure is different in a development tree,
those instructions don't work unaltered here.

The changes you need to make are :-

* It is up to you to know which platform you are on and choose the
  correct Makefile and also set MLWORKS_INCLUDE.  Under
  under SunOS, you can build the library by doing :-

    $ make -f Makefile.SunOS MLWORKS_INCLUDE=../../../src/rts/src

* To run the example from this directory you need to set up the
  source-path to point at the src directory of your development tree.
  Assuming you want to point to the one contained in the same tree as
  the demo directory, then under SunOS you'd type something like :-

    $ ../../../src/rts/bin/SPARC/SunOS/main-g -load ../../../src/images/SPARC/SunOS/gui.img -pass args -tty -source-path .:../../../src args


From then on the instructions are as per README.txt
