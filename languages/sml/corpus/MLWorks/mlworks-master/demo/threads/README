The following directory contains simple demos for the mutual exclusion
primitives defined in $.utils.__mutex:

    Dining Philosophers Problem       dining_philosophers.sml
    Producer-Consumer Problem         bounded_buffer.sml
    Sleeping Barber Problem           sleeping_barber.sml
    Cigarette Smokers Problem         cigarette_smokers.sml
    Readers and Writers Problem       readers_writers.sml

each of these save bounded_buffer.sml write an output log to a file.

When loaded, each is run using the function

	<run function> interval timeLimit

where <run function> is one of:

	runPhilosophers
	runProdCons
	runBarber
	runSmokers
	runReadWrite

and interval is the number of milliseconds each thread is run before
preemption.  A suitable interval for the Unix machines is 10, and for
the PC, 1.  timeLimit is the number of seconds the demo runs for.  A
suitable timeLimit is 10.
