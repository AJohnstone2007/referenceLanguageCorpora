SmlTk 2.1 ported to MLWorks is basically working but no 
guarantees are given and some tweeks might be needed.

The src/ directory contains the MLWorks source files comprising
the port and was built using MLWorks 2.0.  

The tar file contains the original SmlTk 2.1 distribution that
the port was adapted from.

IMPORTANT NOTE
--------------

Please check the SmlTk license before making public any part of 
the SmlTk port as permission or a fee is necessary to use SmlTk
commercially - see license info in the tar file.
