Request #30210:  Inspector doesn't update automatically when Value
Printer options change.

When changing the options within Usage->ToolSettings->ValuePrinter
applied to an Inspector window, the changes can now be seen in the
Inspector window immediately when those changes are applied from the
Value Printer dialog box.  Also the graph within the Inspector is left
unchanged and stays open - the graph has its own internal Value
Printer options which are unchangable by the user.
