3/10/97  Request #30137: Hide GC messages

All GC messages in the GUI are now sent to a 'System Messages' window
which can be brought up from the Usage->SystemMessages menu command
The Usage->SystemMessages command should be able to be invoked from
any window from which you can also access the Tools menu (with the 
exception of the System Messages window itself).
