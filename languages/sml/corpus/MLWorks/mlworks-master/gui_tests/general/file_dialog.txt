Bug #1300:  File dialog should remember its directory
Fixed by change #2823

Bug behaviour:  File dialog does not remember the directory it was last in.

Repeat by:  Select File->LoadSource from the Listener menu, and load some
source file which is not in the current directory.  Then select 
File->LoadSource again.  The correct behaviour here is that the file dialog
will now display the directory it last visited (in this case the directory 
where you loaded the source file from).

Bug #1591:  File dialog does not observe current directory.
Fixed by change #2824

Behaviour:  When the file system directory is changed the file dialog 
should then start in the new directory when it is next invoked.

Repeat by:  In Listener, load system/__os_file_sys.sml and type:
	OSFileSys_.chDir <new dir>;
where <new dir> is a different directory than the current directory.
Then invoke the file dialog by selecting File->LoadFromSource and the
file dialog should pop in the new directory.

Bug #2022: GUI+UNIX: File dialog only accepts directory ending in "/"

Bug Description: If you type a directory name into the Selection area of a
File dialog that is expecting a directory but don't include a trailing
"/" , then the entry is not accepted but no indication of the reason is
given.  It should accept the directory and add the remaining "/" if 
necessary.

Repeat by:

  Start up MLWorks and select Podium>Path>Source Path

This should pop up a Source Path window.  From that select
Action>Insert Entry.

Type the following (but replace "/u/stephenb/test/" with whatever is
appropriate for you) into the Selection :-

  /u/stephenb/test/MLW/src/parser

and press OK.  Nothing visibily happens.  The entry is not added
to the Source Path and nor is any message displayed indicating that
the entry is unacceptable.


Proper behaviour: the entry is added whether or not there is a 
trailing "/"

Change #2709:  NT: open_file_dialog and friends

Check that the Open File dialog works on NT 4.0.  Currently it is the
old style.

Request #01860: explorer style file_dialogs
10/10/97

The above gui test is now redundant because of the decision to revert
back to the use of explorer style file dialogs on NT 4.0.  To test
this, select File->LoadFromSource (or any command which invokes a 
file or directory choosing dialog) and the dialog that appears should
be in the explorer style on NT 4.0.  On NT 3.51, the old style should
still be in use.
