Bug #1948:  Windows NT 3.51: Changing source path can crash MLWorks. 
Fixed by change #2870

Repeat by:  On podium, from menu, select Paths->Source Path, then 
select Action->Insert Selection on Source Path window, and press OK.
The bug consists of MLWorks crashing at this point, but the correct 
behaviour is that the selected path is inserted into the source path
list if it is not already there.
