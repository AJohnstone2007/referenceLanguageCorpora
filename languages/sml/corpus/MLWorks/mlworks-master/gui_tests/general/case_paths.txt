Bug #1967:  Win32: Paths should ignore case.
Fixed by change #2916

Repeat by:  In registry, go to the following key:
HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/Harlequin/MLWorks
and change the path settings to include a mixture of lowercase and 
uppercase letters, but do not change the actual paths.  Then type 
the following on a command line:

ml_batch -compile-file <filename>
where <filename> is a legal file name of an ML source file.

Bug behaviour:  the compilation will fail, giving an error message
like:  'can't find parent for module name:   foo'

Proper behaviour:  the compilation will succeed, and path settings
will be displayed in lower case.
