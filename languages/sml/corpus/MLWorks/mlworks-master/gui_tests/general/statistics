MLWorks-Bug:    1925
MLWorks-Change: 2852

Run mlworks with the -statistics option :-

  $ mlworks -statistics

Then select File>Exit and quit MLWorks.  If all is well, you should
see some statistics in the shell that you invoked MLWorks from,
something like :-

  Raise count: 6145
  Stack extension count: 721
  Maximum transient arena size: 35152k
  Maximum heap size: 25028k

but the numbers will be different.  If nothing appears, or even worse
the following appears :-

  [Fatal signal handler dying: Fatal signal raised by handler]
  Segmentation fault

then it is a bug.
