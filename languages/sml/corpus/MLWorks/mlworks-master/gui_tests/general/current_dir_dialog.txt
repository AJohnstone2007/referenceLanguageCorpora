Bug #1769:  Motif: Current directory dialog
Fixed by change #2922

Repeat by:  On podium menu, select Paths->Current Directory.  Select a 
directory from the list and click OK.

Bug behaviour:  The text box below the directory list is not changed (it 
should be changed just after the selection is made) and the current 
directory is not changed.

Proper behaviour:  The text box is chanegd to show the selection made 
and the current directory is changed successfully.
