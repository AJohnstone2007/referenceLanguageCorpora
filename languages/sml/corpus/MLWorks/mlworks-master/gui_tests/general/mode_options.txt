Request #30229: Grouping compiler options.

The Listener > Properties > Mode dialog now has three modes
for evaluating which are mutually exclusive.  The quick
compile mode should be on by default.  The difference 
between the optimizing mode and the quick compile mode is 
whether Shell.Options.Compiler.generateLocalFunctions is
turned on, and this can be tested from the interactive 
session, by setting this option and seeing the effect it
has on the modes.  Do this by calling 
Shell.Options.set(Shell.Options.Compiler.generateLocalFunctions, true);
