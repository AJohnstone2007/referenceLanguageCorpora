Request #30241:  Implement a more general, and proper looking Win32
find dialog.

Choosing Usage->Find at the appropriate times (eg, from the dependency
graph) should bring up a typical Win32 find dialog with options to
match case, match the whole word and/or search up or down.  Some of
these options may not be visible depending on what the find dialog is
being used for.  At present the find dialog is only used in the graph
widget, which is used by the browser tool and the dependency graph.
In both these cases the only extra option visible is to match the
string against either a whole word or a part of a word.  Pressing the
Find Next button should find the next occurence of the typed search
string, indicating that no more are to be found with a beep.


-------------------------------------

Request #50067:  invoking searching for context and system browsers.

(Win32 change only)
The find dialog should work for both browsers.  Choose Usage->Find 
from either browser, type in a search string and click FindNext 
button.  If no matches are found you should hear a beep, otherwise 
the next match is highlighted in the browser window.
