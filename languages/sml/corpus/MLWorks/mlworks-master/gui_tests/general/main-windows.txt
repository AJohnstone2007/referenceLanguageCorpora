Request #30185.  main-windows.exe is broken

This breaks due to a messsage attempting to be printed on a
non-existent console window.  The message which caused main-windows
not to work was the source path.  The source path is no longer printed
on the console window unless it is specified on the command line.
main-windows will still work if the source path is specified on the
command line.
