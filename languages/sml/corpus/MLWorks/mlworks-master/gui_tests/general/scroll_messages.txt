Bug #1883: Podium fails to scroll
Fixed by change #2820

Bug behaviour:  When a lot of text is displayed by the podium, it does not scroll
to the bottom to display the latest message.

Repeat by:  In Listener, type: 
	MLWorks.IO.output (MLWorks.IO.messages, <S>);
where <S> is a string (or number of strings) which is too big to be fully displayed 
in the podium.

Proper behaviour:  The podium should scroll to the bottom of the messages window.
