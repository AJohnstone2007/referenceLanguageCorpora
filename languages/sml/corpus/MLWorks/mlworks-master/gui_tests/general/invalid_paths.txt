Bug #1965:  Invalid paths not handled properly for pervasive-dir and source-path
Fixed by change #2881

Repeat by:  On command line type:  ml_batch -pervasive-dir foo
where foo is an invalid directory, ie one that does not exist.

Bug behaviour:  A NotSet[main._io] exception reaches the top level without 
being caught - this is wrong.

Proper behaviour:   The following output should be produced:

Bug #2024: GUI+UNIX: Source Path dialog and invalid directories 

Bug Description: If you type the name of a directory that does not exist
into the Selection area of a Source Path, then the directory is
accepted and added to the Source Path, but a warning is displayed in
the shell from which MLWorks was invoked.  

Proper behaviour:  A message box should pop up to indicate that an 
invalid path was given, and the file dialog stays open to allow the 
user to try another path.  The invalid path is not added to the source
path.

Repeat by:

  Start up MLWorks and select Podium>Path>Source Path

This should pop up a Source Path window.  From that select
Action>Insert Entry.

Type the following into the Selection area :-

  /nosuchdir/

and press OK.  The entry is added to the source path but the following
appears in the shell :-

  unknown location: warning: Bad path '/nosuchdir/', ignoring
