Request #30187:  (Win95 only)  Horizontal scrolling.

This was a bug only on Windows 95.  In a Listener (or other window
with a scrolled text control) type a long variable or string and
shorten the width of the window so that the scrollbar size is less
than half the width of the scrolled text control.  Click on the
background of the scrollbar, and instead of moving directly to the end
of the scrollbar the scrollbar position will only change by one page
width as desired.  All other ways of using the scrollbar should work
as before.
