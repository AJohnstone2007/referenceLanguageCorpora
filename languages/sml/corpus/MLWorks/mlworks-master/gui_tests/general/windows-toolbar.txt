Request #30056:  Podium toolbar for Windows.

Every tool button on the toolbar should have a corresponding menu
item, except for the interrupt button, and each button should be 
consistent with the menu item in terms of exactly the action it 
carries out and in terms of when it is highlighted and available,
and also in terms of its style, ie whether it is either a toggle
button or a push button.

The tooltips should work at all times, but may be a bit slow 
during evaluation as expected and predictable.
