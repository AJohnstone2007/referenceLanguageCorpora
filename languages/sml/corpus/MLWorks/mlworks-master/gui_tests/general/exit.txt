Bug #1923: Win32: MLWorks locks if exit dialog dismissed using system menu
Fixed by change #2863

Behaviour:  MLWorks locks (has to be killed using task manager) when
the exit dialog is invoked and then dismissed by clicking on the 'x'
on the top right of the dialog (or by using the system menu from the top
left of the dialog).

Repeat by:  Select File->Exit
	    Dismiss the exit dialog by selecting the 'x' button
	    Attempt to close MLWorks, or select any menu item: MLW has
locked up and can only be closed by killing the task.

Proper behaviour:  The exit dialog should not have a system menu or an 
'x' at the top right of the dialog.

----------------------------

Change 2842:  Quitting MLWorks on MIPS/Irix sometimes causes a SIGSEGV

Start MLWorks, create a listener, close the listener, and exit MLWorks.
All should work fine.
