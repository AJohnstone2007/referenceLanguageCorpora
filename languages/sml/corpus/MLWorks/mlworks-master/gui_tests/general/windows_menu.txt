Request #30175:  Combining tools and windows menus on all platforms.

The Windows menu (ie. that which used to contain a dynamic list of
current MLWorks windows) is now combined with the tools menu, and its
contents have changed.  The tools menu contains the top level tools as
before, but now also includes references to other MLWorks windows
excluding the top level tools and dialogs, such as the preferences
dialogs.  Duplicated windows of the top level tools are also
included.  On Windows the podium is not included in the dynamic list,
but it is included on Motif.

There should be a one-to-one correspondence between items in the tools
menu and currently open MLWorks windows.
