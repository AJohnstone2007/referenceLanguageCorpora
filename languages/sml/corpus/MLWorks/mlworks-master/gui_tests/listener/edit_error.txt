Request #02030:  Edit Error menu item not disabled properly.

The Listener->EditError menu item has been removed to avoid
confusion with the menu item Edit->EditSource, but in the 
case of its inclusion again, it has been fixed so that the 
menu item is disabled when it is not relevant, for example 
when a new Listener is created.
