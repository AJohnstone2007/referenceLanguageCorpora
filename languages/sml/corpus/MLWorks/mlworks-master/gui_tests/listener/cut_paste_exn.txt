Bug #1992:  Win32: Cut and paste before prompt in Listener raises subscript
Fixed by change #2895

Repeat by:  In a Listener window, cut some text before the prompt using 
the cut menu option from the pop up menu when you click the right mouse 
button over the listener window.  Repeat the action a second time, then 
using the same menu, paste the text after the prompt.

Bug behaviour:  A subscript exception will be raised.

Proper behaviour:  The above actions should not be allowed, in particular
cutting text before the prompt should never be possible.  This is currently
restricted by disabling the menu altogether so that nothing happens when 
the user clicks the right mouse button.  Ideally though the menu should 
pop up with various menu options disabled.
