Bug #1981:  Windows: Search/Match box can be outside the display
Fixed by change #2872

Repeat by:  In Listener, select Edit->Find from the menu to bring up the
search dialog box, then position the search dialog box so that the Apply
button is very close to the edge of the screen, then make changes within 
the dialog and click the Apply button.

Bug behaviour:  The Matches pop up dialog now appears but part of it is 
not visible as it is off the edge of the screen.

Proper behaviour:  No matter where the Search dialog is positioned when 
the user clicks the Apply button, the Matches dialog box will always 
fully appear inside the desktop window (ie. fully visible).
