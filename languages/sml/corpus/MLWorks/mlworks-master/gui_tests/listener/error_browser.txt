30/9/97, request #30231: Win32: error browser stays in Tools menu when
Listener is killed.

This should not happen anymore basically.  Type an error into the
listener, bringing up the error browser, check the Tools menu which
should contain an entry for the error browser, then kill the listener
and check the Tools menu, which should now not contain an entry for
the error browser.
