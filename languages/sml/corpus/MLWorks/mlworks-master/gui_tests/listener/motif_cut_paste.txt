Bug #1973:  Motif: Wrong style of cut and paste behaviour.
Fixed by change #2865

Bug behaviour:  Cutting and pasting text using the options from the Edit 
menu was the same as cutting and pasting using mmouse actions.  Also using 
the options from the Edit menu disbled further uses of the middle mouse
button in the same window.

Proper behaviour:  There are two different ways of cutting and pasting text. 
One is to use the options from the Edit menu and the other is to select the 
text and then paste it by clicking the middle mouse button.  Using these 
different ways should give different results.  An example of proper 
behaviour is detailed below.

Example of proper behaviour:  In a Listener window, select some text and 
then click the middle mouse button to paste the selection after the prompt.
Call this text A.  Then select a different piece of text (B) and choose 
Edit->Copy from the Listener menu, then click after the prompt to deselect
the text.  Choose Edit->Paste from the menu, and text B should be pasted
at the cursor position.  Click the middle mouse button with nothing 
selected, and nothing should be pasted, although Edit-> paste should still
paste text B.  Select a different piece of text and paste it using the 
middle mouse button, then choose Edit->Paste again, and text B should still
be pasted.  This behaviour is correct since these two methods use 
different places to store the selected text.
