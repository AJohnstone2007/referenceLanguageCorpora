Request 02009.  Win32 demos: Resizing the tetris and life windows.

The problem was that these windows were resizable using either the system
menu or by dragging one of the sides of the window.  The fix has the 
desired effect of not allowing these windows to be resized at all or to
allow them to be maximized either.
