Bug #1954:  Win32: Profiler messy when resized to be smaller and slider not
	    working properly.
Fixed by change #2869

Repeat by:  In Listener, invoke the profiler by typing an expression and
pressing 'Profile'.

Bug report :

1. On the Time/Space scroll bar, the arrow buttons at the ends are not
synchronised with the slider bar.  For example, move the slider all the way
along to the right hand end, then press the right arrow button - the slider
jumps back close to the left hand end.  Keep pressing the right arrow
button, and after the slider has returned to the right hand end, some of the
bars on the graph start to show negative values, and after a while the scale
changes so that the tallest bars show over 100%.  A similar effect can be
seen by pressing the left arrow button when the slider is at the left hand
end of the bar.

Proper behaviour: arrow buttons are synchronized, and the values of the 
tallest bars are never over 100%.  Also the Time/Space scroll bar can now
be adjusted by clicking in the space between one end of the bar and the 
slider button on the bar.

2. If the profiler window is resized, making it narrower, 
a) the Time/Space scroll bar does not shrink to fit the window, so the right
hand end is inaccessible
b) the horizontal scroll bar that appears on the graph covers the graph
baseline.

3. After resizing the profiler window a few times (has happened as early as
the second resize operation, but may take several more), the profiler window
becomes blank (white) and MLWorks hangs.  This is a little more difficult to
reproduce, but does seem to happen quite regularly, particularly when
resizing by grabbing the bottom right corner of the window and shrinking it.

Proper behaviour: Profiler window cannot be resized below a certain minimum
size which ensures that the above doesn't happen.
