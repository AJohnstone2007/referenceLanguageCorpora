Request #30068:  Combining the Breakpoint and Trace managers into one
top level tool.

The following rules apply:

The combined Break/Trace manager should always be available from the
Tools menu, and on Windows platforms it should be available from the 
toolbar as well.

Only one of each of the Break/Trace manager and the input dialog (for
adding new break and trace points) should ever be visible.

The buttons on the BT manager are shortcuts of menu items.
Specifically, Edit->Delete, Edit->DeleteAll and
Usage->AddBreak/TracePoint.

On the input dialog (invoked by clicking the 'Add Break/Trace Point' 
button or menu item) the 'No. of breakpoints to skip' text field is 
ignored when adding trace points and only the integer value is
relevant when adding a break point.  If nothing is in the 'Name' 
text field, nothing gets added to the list.  

Both Break points (B) and trace points (T) are added to the same list
on the Break/Trace manager, and no duplicates of break points nor of
trace points are allowed.

The break/trace manager window should be available from the Windows
menu when the manager has been created.
