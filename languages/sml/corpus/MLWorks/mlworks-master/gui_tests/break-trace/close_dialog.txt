Bug #1854: Windows: Breakpoint and Trace Managers do not reappear after 
	   closing them using the system menu.
Fixed by change #2857

Bug behaviour:  From the podium menu, select an option from the Break/Trace
menu, then close the new dailog that appeared (which should be either the 
Breakpoint or Trace Manager) by clicking on the 'x' at the top right of the
dialog window, or by choosing an option from the system menu, but not by 
clicking OK or Cancel.  Then try to bring up the same Manager by choosing 
the same option from the Break/Trace menu.  The original bug was that the 
dialog does not reappear, whereas the proper behaviour is obvious in that it
should reappear no matter how it is closed.
