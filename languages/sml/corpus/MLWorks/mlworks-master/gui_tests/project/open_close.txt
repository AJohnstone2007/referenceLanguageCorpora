Request #30384:  Project window should be open when project open.

The project workspace window should be open only if a project
exists, and conversely, if a project exists then the project 
workspace window should be open to show that.  To test this, 
try closing the project window with a changed project and you 
should be asked if you want to save the project.  Cancelling
that operation should not result in the project workspace 
window being closed as the project still exists.  Also try 
starting MLWorks with an image which has an open project (ie.
after saving a session with an open project), and the project
workspace window should start up automatically.
