Bug #1826 NT: CM View>Clear Log causes set_insertion_position failure.
Fixed by change #2735

Bug behaviour:  In Compilation Manager, load any source so that the log area is not 
empty, then select View->Clear Log.  Any action hereafter (such as loading more 
source) which changes the Log causes a warning to be given of the form: set 
insertion position failure.

Proper behaviour:  No warning is given.
