Request #50073:  guib Project Workspace problem finding mos.

The cause of this bug was that relative paths were not working
for new projects.  To test that it now works, create a new 
project, and try changing the object directory making sure 
that relative paths are specified.  The correct behaviour
should allow you to change the directory whereas before, the
directory was not changed.  Also a warning should be given to 
the effect that relative paths will become invalid, when you 
save a project for the first time or save a project to a 
different directory.
