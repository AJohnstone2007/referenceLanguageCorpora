Bug #1850:  Windows: touch source broken in compilation manager
Fixed by change #2862

Behaviour:  In the Compilation Manager, read the dependencies of any ml
source file using File->ReadDependencies, then select a unit in the CM, 
followed by choosing Build->Touch->Source from the menu in the 
Compilation Manager.  Make sure that the unit selected was not 
read-only.  The bug behaviour was that a message box popped up giving 
an indication that the file can't be touched, whereas the correct
behaviour is that a message box will pop up saying that the file was
touched.
