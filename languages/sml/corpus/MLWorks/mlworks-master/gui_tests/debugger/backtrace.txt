Request 30193:  Print Backtrace to System Messages window.
10/10/97

A new menu command has been introduced to print a backtrace from the
debugger window (stack browser) into the System Messages window, which
enables the user to copy and paste a backtrace into their mailer to
send to us.  From the stack browser, choose Usage->PrintBacktrace,
then a message box will appear to notify the user that a backtrace has
been printed in the System Messages window, and then choosing
Usage->SystemMessages will allow the user to see the textual
backtrace.  Also the size of the podium on Win32 platforms has changed
due to the messages text box being removed.  On both NT3.51 and NT4.0
(essential to check both) the podium should contain a menu and a
toolbar only.
