.SH NAME
mlbatch \- The MLWorks 2.0 batch compiler
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mlbatch
[
.I options
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The batch compiler uses the MLWorks project system to compile 
Standard ML source files with the suffix
.B .sml
into MLWorks object files.  Object files have the suffix
.B .mo
and are suitable for loading into
.BR mlrun (1)
or
.BR mlpervasive (1)
for execution.  The batch compiler requires a project file, 
which must have been previously created using the MLWorks GUI.
.LP
Dependencies between files must be specified by the 
.B require
reserved word, a language extension (see the
.I MLWorks User Guide
for details).
.LP
.B mlbatch
is a shell script which invokes
.BR mlrun (1)
on an ML image containing the MLWorks compiler.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 6
.B -verbose
Enable verbose mode.  When in verbose mode the system will give
messages indicating the various options interpreted during argument
processing, otherwise it will not.
.TP
.B -silent
Disable verbose mode.
.TP
.B -project \fIfilename
Specifies the project file to use.  This must precede all the 
following options on the command line.
.TP
.B -mode \fIname
Specifies which mode to use.  The project must have been specified
earlier on the command line.  Reports an error if the mode does 
not exist in the specified project file.  This option overrides 
the setting of the current mode in the project file.  If no mode 
is specified on the command line, the current mode specified in 
the project file is used.  The modes 'Debug' and 'Release' exist
in every project.
.TP
.B -target \fIname
Specifies a target to recompile.  The project must have been 
specified earlier on the command line, and also reports an error
if the target does not exist in the specified project file.  
Multiple targets may be specified by repeated use of this option.
If any options are specified on the command line, the current 
targets set in the project file are ignored.  If no 
targets are specified on the command line, those specified as 
current in the project file are recompiled.
.TP
.B -configuration \fIname
If the project includes configurations, this specifies which one
to use.  The project must have been specified earlier on the 
command line and also reports an error if the configuration does 
not exist in the specified project file.  This option overrides 
the setting of the current configuration in the project file.
If a project includes configurations, and none is specified on 
the command line, the current configuration specified in the 
project file is used.
.TP
.B -object-path \fIdirectory
Specifies the directory in which to find and/or put the object
files.  The project must have been specified earlier on the 
command line.  This overrides the specification in the project
file.  If the directory includes the string "%S", this is
expanded to the directory containing the source file.
.TP
.B -build 
Builds the specified project using the current targets in the 
current configuration (if any) with the current mode.
.TP
.B -show-build 
Show the files that would be recompiled by 
.B -build 
option.
.TP
.B -list-objects
Show all the files that are used in the building of the current 
targets.
.TP
.B -source-path \fIpath
Sets the path that
.B mlbatch
searches for source files.
.I path
is a colon-separated list of directories.  For example,
~/ml/src:/usr/sml/src.  The default path contains the current
directory and the directory in which 
.B MLWorks
was installed.
.TP
.B -compile \fIsource-file-names
Process the source files in compile mode.  Inclusion of the 
.B .sml 
suffix in source file names is optional.  For each file compiled,
produces an MLWorks object file with a name that has the same stem as
the source file, but a   
.B .mo
suffix.
.TP
.B -check-dependencies \fIsource-file-names
Process the source files in check-dependencies mode.  Inclusion of the 
.B .sml 
suffix in source file names is optional.  Produces a list of the
source files that would be compiled if you submitted the same list of
files to the
.B -compile
option.
.TP
.B -old-definition \fIon/off
When set to on, use the semantics of the old version of SML, dating back to
1990.  Default set to off.
.TP
.B -<option> \fI<option_arg>
The following compiler/language options may be set on the command 
line.  These override the settings in the mode specified.  They 
must follow the -mode argument, which must be present.
.TP
.B -debug \fIon/off
Generate (set to on) debugging information for all declarations in 
the files compiled.  
.TP
.B -debug-variables \fIon/off
Generate (set to on) variable debugging information.
.TP
.B -trace-profile \fIon/off
Generate code that can (or cannot) be traced or profiled with the call 
counter, for all declarations in the files compiled.  Default off.
.TP
.B -interrupt \fIon/off
Interruptable code enabled (set to on) or disabled.
.TP
.B -mips-r4000-and-later \fIon/off
Compile code for MIPS R400 and later versions.  Default on.
.TP
.B -sparc-v7 \fIon/off
Compile code for version 7 of the SPARC architecture.  Default off.
.TP
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP 20
.SB MLWORKS_SRC_PATH
If set, its value overrides the default search path, which contains the
current directory and the directory in which MLWorks was installed.  (The
.B -source-path 
flag, in turn, overrides this value.)
