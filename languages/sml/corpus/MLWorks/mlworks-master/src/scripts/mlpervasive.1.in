.LP
.B mlpervasive
evaluates MLWorks object files.  Object files have a 
.B .mo
suffix.  The object files are loaded in the order listed.
The order in which you list the object files for loading is important,
since an object file may only refer to code from files that have
already been loaded.  
.LP
.B mlpervasive
is a convenience command that calls
.BR mlrun (1)
and automatically loads the pervasive library, which is required
by all user code.  Options valid for
.BR mlrun (1)
are also valid for
.BR mlpervasive .
