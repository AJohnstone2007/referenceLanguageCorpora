SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

To run the Windows 95 version of MLWorks 1.1 we recommend at least 20
MB RAM.  For running on Windows NT, we recommend at least 24 MB RAM. For
Windows 95 and Windows NT the installed system takes up around 25 MB.



INSTALLING MLWORKS FOR MICROSOFT WINDOWS

After downloading your MLWorks distribution from the Harlequin web site,
you must unpack it.

    WARNING - INSTALLATION ON NTFS

    When installing onto an NTFS file system, remember to set your system
    time zone to GMT and disable daylight saving time before installing.
    Once installed, MLWorks will run correctly with your usual settings.
    FAT file systems do not require this adjustment (and therefore this
    adjustment is never required under Windows 95).

1. Using Windows Explorer, go to the folder containing the MLWorks
distribution.

2. Double-click on setup.exe.

The InstallShield(TM) application will now guide you through MLWorks
installation.

MLWorks is now fully installed.



VIEWING MLWORKS DOCUMENTATION

When you have completed the installation of MLWorks on Windows you can
view the user documentation from the documentation folder in the
MLWorks folder. The User Guide and Reference Manual are also available
online as shortcuts from the program group in which you installed
MLWorks.

To download documentation independently form the rest of the
distribution, see "MLWorks Versions and Upgrades" above.



RUNNING MLWORKS

When you run MLWorks for the first time please enter your Licence
Name and key as shown on the covering letter.
