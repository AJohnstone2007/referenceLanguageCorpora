.SH NAME
mlimage \- Restarts an MLWorks session saved in an image file.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mlimage
[
.B -mono 
]
.B -load 
.I image-file 
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.B mlimage
restarts an
.B MLWorks
session saved in an image file (a 
.B \.img
file) with the File > Save Image menu item on
the
.B MLWorks
console, or with the interactive context function 
.B Shell.saveImage.
For running other image files, use 
.B mlrun\fR(1).
.LP
.B mlimage
starts MLWorks as though you have called
.B mlworks\fR(1)
and reinstates the top-level interactive context as it stood at
the time the image file was saved.  All items evaluated and loaded
into MLWorks at that time will be available in the restarted image.
Preference settings, trace manager, and breakpoint manager settings
are also reinstated. 
.SH OPTIONS

.B -load \fIfilename
Restart the session image in 
.I filename
.TP 6
.B -mono 
Disables the use of colours in X, and should  be given when

is used on a monochrome screen.
