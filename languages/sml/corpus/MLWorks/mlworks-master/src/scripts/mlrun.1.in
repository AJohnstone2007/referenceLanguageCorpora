.SH NAME
mlrun \- MLWorks runtime system
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mlrun
[
.I options
]
.I object-file-names
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.B mlrun
provides the run-time environment support for executing MLWorks object
files.  Object files have a
.B .mo
suffix.  The object files are loaded in the order listed.
The order in which you list the object files for loading is important,
since an object file may only refer to code from files that have
already been loaded.  
.SH FILE OPTIONS
.TP 6
.B --
This option does nothing, but nothing after it on the command line
is treated as an option.
.TP
.B -load \fIfilename
Load an image from
.I filename
before loading any object files.
.TP
.B -from \fIfilename
Read object-file names from the file
.I filename
before reading them from the command line.
.TP
.B -save \fIfilename
Load all object files specified and then save the image in
.I filename.
.TP
.B -MLWpass \fIdelimiter argument... delimiter
Passes the arguments between the
.I delimiter
strings through to the runtime. Any arguments passed after the closing
delimiter will be passed through to the runtime environment. When
running with the standard pervasive library these further arguments
will appear as the result of the basis function CommandLine.arguments,
or the MLWorks function MLWorks.arguments. The delimiter may be any
string.
.SH MEMORY MANAGEMENT OPTIONS
.TP 6
.B -c \fIn
Report garbage collections at level
.I n
and above.
.TP
.B -limit \fIn,
Specifies an advisory arena extent size in Mb (default 100).
Collection frequency will increase as the amount of
virtual memory used by the process approaches this amount.
.TP
.B -stack \fIn,
Set the initial maximum number of stack blocks to
.I n\fR.
.TP
.B -batch,
Run in non-interactive mode; i.e. do not prompt when
virtual memory is exhausted.
.SH PROFILING OPTIONS
.TP 6
.B -profile \fIfilename
Profile the entire run, recording profiling information in
.I filename.
.TP
.B -profile-scan \fIn
When profiling, scan the stack every
.I n
virtual milliseconds to
gather information.  An interval of zero disables scanning.
Scanning is not enabled by default.
.TP
.B -profile-depth \fIn
When profiling with scanning, record patterns of caller functions
to a depth of
.I n
callers.  The default is zero.
.TP
-profile-select \fIstring
When profiling, only record information about functions which include
.I string
in their names.  By default, all functions are profiled.
.TP
.B -profile-manner \fIn
A bit value to determine which forms of profiling are to be done.
Relevant bits are: 
.RS 8
.TP
Bit 0 - set for call counting
.TP
Bit 1 - set for time profiling
.TP
Bit 2 - set for space profiling
.TP
Bit 3 - set for space profile copying analysis 
.RS 8
(survival times for allocated values) 
.RE
.TP
Bits 8-15 - set for space profile runtime type analysis
.RS 6
(allocation and copying broken down according to "type")
.RE

.SH MISCELLANEOUS OPTIONS
.TP 6
.B -mono
Use the X resources for a monochrome screen.
.TP
.B -verbose
Display information about the activities of the runtime system.
.TP
.B -statistics
Display various internal statistics at the end of the run.
.TP
.B -help
Display information about command usage.
.SH MESSAGE OUTPUT
.LP
Any messages output by the runtime system will be sent to the
standard error stream.  Messages which are not fatal errors are
enclosed in brackets (\fB[\fR and \fB]\fR) and printed on a new line.
These are not usually nested.
