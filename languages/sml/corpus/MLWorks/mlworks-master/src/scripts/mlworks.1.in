.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.B mlworks
invokes the MLWorks system as an interactive incremental
compiler with a GUI and programming tools.  Standard ML
declarations and expressions can be typed at the prompt and are
compiled and incorporated into the SML interactive environment.  The
incremental compiler also has facilities for performing separate
compilation of source files and for invoking the batch compiler.  
.LP 
.B mlworks
is a shell script which invokes
.BR mlrun (1) 
on an ML image containing the incremental compiler and GUI
environment. 
.LP
For a full description of the interactive environment, see the
.I MLWorks User Guide.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 6
.B -mono
Disables the standard use of multiple colors in the GUI.
Should be given when 
.B mlworks
is used on a monochrome screen.
.TP
.B -gui
Starts up the MLWorks GUI.  This happens by default.
.TP
.B -tty 
Starts MLWorks up in teletype mode instead of in the GUI.  The GUI can
be subsequently started from the prompt by calling the interactive
context function
.B Shell.startGUI. 
.TP
.B -debug-mode
Sets debug compilation mode at startup.  All SML code will be compiled
with debugging information by default.  Debug mode can also be
adjusted using the MLWorks console's Preferences > Mode menu item.
.TP
.B -optimize-mode
Sets optimize compilation mode at startup.  By default, all SML code
will be fully optimized during compilation.  Optimize mode can also be
adjusted using the MLWorks console's Preferences > Mode menu item.
.TP
.B -no-init
Do not read the MLWorks initialization file, 
.B .mlworks,
from the user's home directory.  If it exists, the contents of the
.B .mlworks
file are read unless this option is given.  The file can contain any
valid SML code.  
.TP
.B -silent
Turn off printing of messages about using, loading or
compiling files.  Also suppresses the MLWorks prompt.
.TP
.B -stack \fIn\fP
Set the initial maximum number of stack blocks to \fIn\fP, where
\fIn\fP is a positive integer.  The default value for \fIn\fP is 5.
.TP
.B -help
Display information about command usage.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP 20
.SB MLWORKS_PERVASIVE
If set, its value overrides the default location for the
.B MLWorks
pervasive library.
.TP
.SB MLWORKS_SRC_PATH
If set, its value overrides the default search path, which contains just the
current directory.  The path should be specified as a colon-separated list
of directories, e.g. ~/ml/src:/usr/sml/src.
