 *
 *  Implementation
 *  --------------
 * Clock time and intervals are timeval pairs of integers (second,
 * microsecond), obtained from getrusage(2) and gettimeofday(2). File
 * modification times obtained from stat(2) get zero microseconds
 * (this appears unsafe, but actually is safe because stat(2) times
 * could be on a different machine in any case, so must only ever be
 * compared with each other, and not with now()).
 *
 * Times and intervals are represented to ML as triples of ints, a
 * pair for the seconds (each MLint taking 24 bits, allowing for
 * 48-bit values) and one for the microseconds.
