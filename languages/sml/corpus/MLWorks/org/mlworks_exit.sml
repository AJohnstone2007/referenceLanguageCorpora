 * OS-specific exit/terminate functions.

 * We don't use OS.Process directly because it can't provide

 *
 * Any type/value that shares a name with one in OS.Process behaves 
 * according to the description of that type/value in OS.Process.
 *
 * For more information on the additional error codes see where they are
 * used (mainly main/_batch.sml) since their names and values were initially 
 * based on the context in which they were used and the integer values
 * used in that context.
