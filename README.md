# referenceLanguageCorpora (RLC)

This repository contains programming language grammars and example programs in those languages.

## Subdirectories

1. **languages** contains grammars and example inputs for well some well-known general purpose languages. The **rhul** subfolders contain examples that we have used in many of our research papers. For some languages we have also included large sets of examples drawn from publicaly available repositories. We thank the owners of those repos for making the material available.
See the README.md file in individual directories for details on how these corpora were constructed.

2. **ambiguityTest** contains 'torture' grammars designed to stress-test generalised parsing algorithms.

3. **experiments** contains scripts for running experiments using our own parser implementations, and data collected from those experiments.
 

This collection is curated by Adrian Johnstone and Elizabeth Scott of the Centre for Software Language Engineering at Royal Holloway, University of London.
